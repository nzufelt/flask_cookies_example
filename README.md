# A Simple Flask Example for Demonstrating Cookies

This is a slight variation on the [flask quickstart](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/quickstart/).

Be sure to inspect in your browser to view the cookies this sets!

A minimal collection of code to make this work could be:

```
git clone https://github.com/nzufelt/flask_cookies_example.git
cd flask_cookies_example

pip install flask
export FLASK_APP=hello.py
flask run
```

As detailed in the [flask quickstart](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/quickstart/), the line `export FLASK_APP=hello.py` is `set FLASK_APP=hello.py` for windows machines.
